## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

The vacation rental industry has grown rapidly in recent years, with Airbnb being one of the largest players in the market. With the increasing popularity of Airbnb, understanding the data behind this industry can provide valuable insights for both businesses and tourists.

This project aims to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the 2022 NYC Airbnb dataset to answer the following questions:

**For businesses:**
-  Who are the top hosts with the most listings in NYC?
-  What are the most popular neighborhoods in each borough in NYC?
-  What are the most expensive and cheapest neighborhoods in NYC?
-  What is the distribution of average listing prices across neighborhoods in NYC?
-  How much of a particular home is available on average?
-  How much do prices fluctuate in 2022?
-  What are the most commonly used words in listing names and amenities in NYC?

**For tourists:**
-  What are the top 10 reviewed listings in NYC?
-  What is the character and vibe of each neighborhood in NYC?
-  What are the budget-friendly neighborhoods in NYC?

By answering these questions, this project can provide valuable insights into the competitive landscape of the Airbnb market in NYC and assist businesses in determining areas with the highest demand or potential for growth, as well as setting competitive prices. 

It can also provide tourists with information on highly rated listings, budget-friendly neighborhoods, and the unique character and vibe of each neighborhood in NYC.
## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>
